        <h2>About WinHTTP <i>(MSDN)</i></h2>
        <p>Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) provides developers with a server-supported, high-level interface to the HTTP/1.1 Internet protocol. WinHTTP is designed to be used primarily in server-based scenarios by server applications that communicate with HTTP servers.</p>
        <p>WinHTTP is also designed for use in system services and HTTP-based client applications. WinHTTP is more secure and robust than WinINet. However, single-user applications that require FTP or Gopher protocol functionality, cookie persistence, caching, automatic credential dialog handling, Internet Explorer compatibility, or downlevel platform support should consider using WinInet.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Caution</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;WinHTTP is not reentrant except during asynchronous completion callback. That is, while a thread has a call pending to one of the WinHTTP functions such as WinHttpSendRequest, WinHttpReceiveResponse, WinHttpQueryDataAvailable, WinHttpSendData, or WinHttpWriteData, it must never call WinHTTP a second time until the first call has completed. One scenario under which a second call could occur is as follows: If an application queues an Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC) to the thread that calls into WinHTTP, and if WinHTTP performs an alertable wait internally, the APC can run. If the APC routine happens also to call WinHTTP, it reenters the WinHTTP API, and the internal state of WinHTTP can be corrupted.</p>
